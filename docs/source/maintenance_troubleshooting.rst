Routine Maintenance for CLAS (Early Stage)
==========================================

Backup Recipes Manually
-----------------------
- Since the app is in its early stages, set up a manual backup process.
- Export recipes to a file (e.g., JSON/CSV) using available tools or by copying data into a safe location.

Check for Updates
-----------------
- Regularly check for updates if youâ€™re testing new features or bug fixes.
- Updates may be delivered via direct download or through your development environment.

Clear Temporary Data
--------------------
- If performance issues arise, clear temporary files (manually, if no in-app function exists).
- This can be done by locating and removing unused local files in the app directory.

Monitor the Database
--------------------
- Keep the database lightweight by limiting unnecessary test data.
- Periodically review and remove outdated or duplicate entries.

Common Issues and Simple Fixes (For Early Stage Development)
============================================================

App Crashes Frequently
-----------------------
- **Cause:** Bugs in the code or unhandled exceptions.
- **Fix:**
  - Review the logs for errors and fix them in the code.
  - Restart the app after clearing temporary data.
  - Test new features in isolated environments before integrating them.

Recipe Data Disappears
----------------------
- **Cause:** Issues with saving or loading data from the database.
- **Fix:**
  - Double-check the save/load functions in your code.
  - Ensure the app saves data to a persistent location.

Performance Slows Down
----------------------
- **Cause:** Inefficient queries or too much test data.
- **Fix:**
  - Optimize database queries.
  - Delete unnecessary dummy data.

Login Issues (If Applicable)
----------------------------
- **Cause:** Incomplete user authentication setup.
- **Fix:**
  - Revisit and debug the login API or authentication logic.
  - Use mock data for local testing to avoid server dependency.
