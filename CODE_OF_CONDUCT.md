# Community Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As community members, contributors, and leaders, we are committed to creating an environment where everyone can engage without fear of harassment or discrimination. This commitment extends to all, regardless of age, body size, visible or hidden disabilities, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, educational background, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We aim to foster an open, welcoming, and healthy community by treating each other with respect, inclusiveness, and empathy.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors that help build a constructive environment include:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting diverse perspectives, viewpoints, and experiences
* Offering and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Acknowledging mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
* Prioritizing the community's well-being and inclusivity over individual interests

Behaviors that disrupt a positive environment include:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, or making sexual advances of any kind
* Trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, and engaging in personal or political attacks
* Engaging in public or private harassment
* Disclosing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit consent
* Any conduct that could be reasonably seen as inappropriate in a professional environment

## Leadership Responsibilities

Community leaders are tasked with upholding and enforcing these standards. Leaders may take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, harmful, or offensive.

Leaders reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Reasons for moderation will be communicated when deemed necessary.

## Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies across all community spaces and also extends to those representing the community in public contexts. Representing the community may include using an official email address, posting on an official social media account, or participating in public events as a designated representative.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Reports of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be directed to the community enforcement team at **bae6544@naver.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in a prompt and fair manner.

The privacy and security of individuals reporting incidents will be respected by all community leaders.

## Guidelines for Enforcement

The following guidelines will be used by community leaders to determine appropriate responses to violations:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Minor infractions, such as inappropriate language or behavior that is unprofessional.

**Response**: A private written warning, explaining the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A more significant violation, either as a single incident or a series of actions.

**Response**: A formal warning with consequences for continued behavior. This includes avoiding interactions with those involved for a specified time, both within community spaces and on external platforms such as social media. Continued infractions may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious breach of community standards, such as ongoing disruptive behavior.

**Response**: A temporary ban from all forms of community interaction and public communication for a defined period. During this time, no contact with involved individuals, including community leaders, is allowed. Further violations may result in a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Repeated violations, including persistent harassment or discrimination against individuals or groups.

**Response**: A permanent ban from any form of public interaction in the community.
