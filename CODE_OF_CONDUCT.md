# Community Code of Conduct

## Purpose and Commitment

Our community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment. We are committed to ensuring that every member feels safe, supported, and valued, regardless of their background, identity, or experience level. Our shared goal is to foster a positive, harassment-free experience for all.

## Expected Behaviors

To maintain a constructive and respectful environment, community members are expected to:

* Show kindness and empathy towards others
* Respect diverse opinions and experiences
* Provide and accept constructive feedback thoughtfully
* Take responsibility for their actions and learn from any mistakes
* Prioritize the community's health and inclusivity over individual needs

## Unacceptable Behaviors

Actions that negatively impact the community and are not tolerated include:

* Sexual language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual advances
* Trolling, derogatory comments, personal attacks, or harassment of any kind
* Sharing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct that could be reasonably perceived as inappropriate for a professional community

## Accountability and Consequences

Community leaders are responsible for interpreting and enforcing this Code of Conduct. Leaders may take any action deemed appropriate, including but not limited to the following:

1. **Minor Infraction**: A private warning will be issued, clarifying the nature of the infraction and why it was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
   
2. **Formal Warning**: For repeated or serious issues, a formal warning will be issued, specifying that further incidents will lead to limited interactions or a temporary ban. This may include restrictions on participation in community spaces and other platforms.

3. **Temporary Ban**: In cases of severe or sustained disruption, a temporary ban from community interactions and events will be enforced. Continued infractions may lead to a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**: Members who repeatedly violate the community's standards or engage in particularly harmful actions may be permanently removed from all community activities and spaces.

## Reporting Incidents

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to community leaders at **bae6544@naver.com**. All reports will be treated with confidentiality and reviewed promptly.

## Application of Code

This Code of Conduct applies across all community interactions, whether in online spaces, events, or public settings. Representing the community includes using official emails, social media accounts, or speaking at events on behalf of the community.
