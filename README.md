## Project Description
Chef: Light and Shadow (CLAS) is a community-driven platform that allows users to share their unique and personal recipes with others.

## Problem Statement
Many unique and hidden recipes remain undiscovered, limiting opportunities to explore diverse cuisines. Existing platforms often highlight popular recipes but lack features for sharing personal, creative recipes. CLAS addresses this gap by offering a space for users to upload, share, and receive feedback on their recipes, fostering a creative culinary community.

## Research
This project draws inspiration from platforms like **AllRecipes**, **Yummly**, and **Epicurious**. Unlike these, CLAS emphasizes user creativity and personal storytelling through food, encouraging unique recipe sharing.

## Features
- **Recipe Upload**: Users can upload recipes with photos.
- **Recipe Search**: Search recipes by keywords and ingredients.
- **Community Feedback**: Users can rate, comment, and give feedback on each other's recipes.
- **Differentiation**: Focuses on user creativity, allowing individuals to share personal cooking stories.

## Development Tools and Languages
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS
